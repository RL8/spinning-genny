**Last Updated**: 2025-02-24 05:57:53 UTC

## Implementation Plan Progress

### 1. Create Project Structure ✅
- [x] Create project directory
- [x] Initialize git repository properly:
  - [x] Git directory exists
  - [x] `.gitignore` created with proper rules
  - [x] Initial files staged
  - [x] Initial commit made
  - [x] GitHub repository created and code pushed

### 2. Set Up Initial Files 🔄
- [x] Created package.json with required content
- [x] Dependencies installed via npm install (with --legacy-peer-deps)
- [ ] Verified all dependencies are at correct versions
- [ ] Address npm audit warnings (4 vulnerabilities)

### 3. Create Directory Structure 🔄
Directory creation:
- [x] src/lib/components
- [x] src/lib/server
- [x] src/lib/types
- [x] src/lib/utils
- [x] src/routes
- [x] static

Verification needed:
- [ ] Verify directory structure matches companion file exactly
- [ ] Check for any missing subdirectories
- [ ] Ensure correct file placement

### 4. Add Configuration Files 🔄
File creation:
- [x] svelte.config.js exists
- [x] vite.config.ts exists
- [x] tsconfig.json exists

Verification needed:
- [ ] Verify svelte.config.js matches companion file
- [ ] Verify vite.config.ts matches companion file
- [ ] Verify tsconfig.json matches companion file

### 5. Add Essential SvelteKit Files 🔄
File creation:
- [x] src/app.d.ts
- [x] src/routes/+layout.svelte
- [x] src/routes/+layout.server.ts
- [x] src/routes/+page.svelte

Verification needed:
- [ ] Verify app.d.ts matches companion file
- [ ] Verify +layout.svelte matches companion file
- [ ] Verify +layout.server.ts matches companion file
- [ ] Verify +page.svelte matches companion file

### 6. Combine with Main Artifact 🔄
Components:
- [ ] Copy components to src/lib/components/

Server code:
- [ ] Copy server code to src/lib/server/

Types:
- [ ] Copy types to src/lib/types/

Utils:
- [x] Created logger.ts (with modifications documented)
- [ ] Other utility files

Routes:
- [x] Main routes implemented
- [ ] Additional routes if any
- [ ] Verify all routes match specifications

### 7. Set up Environment 🔄
- [x] .env.example file exists
- [ ] Verify .env.example contains correct variables
- [ ] Create .env with GitHub OAuth credentials

### 8. Verify Setup ❌
- [ ] Run TypeScript check
- [ ] Start development server
- [ ] Verify all features work as expected

## Verification Process
For each completed item:
1. Compare with original specifications
2. Test functionality if applicable
3. Verify dependencies and connections
4. Document any deviations or modifications

## Next Steps
1. Complete git setup and initial commit
2. Verify all existing files match companion file exactly
3. Continue with remaining implementation tasks

## Notes
- Previous progress tracking was too optimistic
- Now including explicit verification steps
- Some items marked complete need reverification
- Maintaining detailed change log in implementation-changes.md
